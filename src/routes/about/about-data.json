		"description": "My interest with computers started when I was a kid. Like others, I spent most of my time playing video games with friends in a computer shop. I always have been fascinated and curious on how computer programs work so I took Computer Science as my college degree. With God's mercy and grace, I graduated in 2016 at Mapua University and immediately took a job as test automation engineer."
